# Adaptable-MRTA
Adaptable Multi-Robot Task Allocation System with task reallocation
Model for an adaptable Multi-Robot Task Allocation algorithm with task reallocation

Before executing the program:
 - Open the 'config.lua' file and edit the value in the 'folder' variable (line 7) with the folder path to the model.
 - Create a 'runs' folder inside the model's folder (used to save the executions' results)

The file 'config.lua' contains all the configurable parameters for the model. These parameters are divided into three groups in the following order:
 - frequently used parameters
 - less commonly used parameters
 - constants and variables for model functionality

Do not make changes in the last group.

To visualize better the results shown in the program console and those in the output files (in 'root folder\runs\file name.txt'), copy them to a Microsoft Excel sheet.
